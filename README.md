# Email spam filter

*	This code should output the accuracy of the spam filter on the test set. Note that this is just a basic implementation and there are many ways to improve the accuracy of the spam filter.
*	This code uses the scikit-learn library to convert the text into bag-of-words vectors using the CountVectorizer class, and trains a logistic regression model using the Logistic Regression class. The code then evaluates the accuracy of the model on the test set using the accuracy_score function from the sklearn.metrics module.
